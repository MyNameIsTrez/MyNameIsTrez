## Greetings! 👋

I'm a passionate backend programmer with over 10 years of experience working on open-source projects in his spare time. Nothing's more valuable than having a deep understanding of the tools at your disposal, which is why I'm currently writing a compiler and linker for [my own programming language](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/02/29/creating-the-perfect-modding-language.html).
